# Water Quality Prediction (Machile Learning Project)
This project demonstrates how ML can be used to prrdict the quality of water using Random Forest Regressor. Other Algorithms were used in evaluating performance. 
Pyhton's Streamlit Data Science and Machine Learning framework has been used in model deployment.
As you explore my dataset, you will understand that the data is non-linear. Therefore constraints are put in place to obtain maximum accuracy.
